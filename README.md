# Breast_Cancer_Detection_with_Different_Standardisation
This project is simply based on Detection of Breast Cancer ie to check whether it is Benign or Malignant. 
We have used KNN algorithm and used 3 different techniques - 
1.Without Standardisation
2.With Normalisation
3.With MinMax Scaler.
The input is stored in the Data folder and outputs are stored in output folder. 
Also Predictive analysis has been stored in excel sheets along with the plots for easy understanding helping Machine Learning Engineer to take the data and deal with it easily.
